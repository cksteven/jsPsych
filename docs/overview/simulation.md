# Simulation Modes
*Added in 7.1*

Simulation mode allows you run your experiment automatically and generate artificial data. 

## Getting Started

To use simulation mode, replace `jsPsych.run()` with `jsPsych.simulate()`.

```js
jsPsych.simulate(timeline);
```

This will run jsPsych in the default `data-only` simulation mode. 
To use the `visual` simulation mode you can specify the second parameter.

```js
jsPsych.simulate(timeline, "data-only");
jsPsych.simulate(timeline, "visual");
```

## What happens in simulation mode

In simulation mode, plugins call their `simulate()` method instead of calling their `trial()` method.
If a plugin doesn't implement a `simulate()` method, then the trial will run as usual and any interaction that is needed to advance to the next trial will be required. Similarly, if a plugin doesn't support `visual` mode, then it will run in `data-only` mode.

### `data-only` mode

In `data-only` mode plugins typically generate resonable artificial data given the parameters specified for the trial. 
For example, if the `trial_duration` parameter is set to 2,000 ms, then any response times generated will be capped at this value. 
Generally the default data generated by the plugin randomly selects any available options (e.g., buttons to click) with equal probability. 
Response times are generated from an exponentially-modified Gaussian distribution truncated to positive values using `jsPsych.randomization.sampleExGaussian()`.

In `data-only` mode, the plugin's `trial()` method generally does not run. 
The data are simply calculated based on trial parameters and the `finishTrial()` method is called immediately with the simulated data.

### `visual` mode

In `visual` mode a plugin will typically generate simulated data for the trial and then use that data to mimic the kinds of actions that a participant would do. The plugin's `trial()` method is called by the simulation, and you'll see the experiment progress in real time. Mouse, keyboard, and touch events are simulated to control the experiment.

In `visual` mode each plugin will generate simulated data in the same manner as `data-only` mode, but this data will instead be used to generate actions in the experiment and the plugin's `trial()` method will ultimately be responsible for generating the data. 
This can create some subtle differences in data between the two modes. 
For example, if the simulated data generates a response time of 500 ms, the `data.rt` value will be exactly `500` in `data-only` mode, but may be `501` or another slightly larger value in `visual` mode.
This is because the simulated response is triggered at `500` ms and small delays due to JavaScript's event loop might add a few ms to the measure.

## Current Limitations

Currently extensions are not supported in simulation mode.
